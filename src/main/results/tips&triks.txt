Escape operator:
- Remove random 1 - 3
- Insert best
- Repeat 20 times

Local search:
- Local search at the end of the ALNS to find local optima

SA Acceptance tuning:
- In the first 100 iterations, fix the probability of accepting worse solutions to 0.8
- In these 100 iterations collect the Deltas (of course when the delta is positive, since negative means you have a better solution and we do not need the probability of acceptance in that case as we always accept better solutions)
- Use the average of collected Deltas to calculate the T_0 such that with the average Delta you get P=0.8 in the Boltzmann function
- Assuming that you want to reach to T_f = 1 after n iterations. Then you can simply find the proper Alpha value. Alpha= POWER((T_f / T_0),(1/n))
Note: T_0 for one instance might be very different from the other instances so that is why we do not fix the T_0 and we use the above process. In this process you get a better estimation of the Delta values because it is average of deltas from the same instance.

T_f = 0.001 - 1
